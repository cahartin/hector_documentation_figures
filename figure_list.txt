Manuscript to do list for CH and BBL:

1. need temperature observations -> Hector R code 1961 to 1990 mean to make data look like OBS. 
2. O3 either fix or disable 								
3. constraint cases slightly off 
after submission 4. documentation --> read me file and getting started guides
CH 5. unconstrained --> initial CO2 values start with higher carbon values over all  1% 3 or 4 ppm range
	check current day conditions of pco2
6. simplify down the figures unconstrained  or 1 figure of constrained historical and totally unconstrained.
BBL 7.  Taylor plot of variables: pCO2 and temperature  with CMIP5 mean and MAGICC

We want to hold the data constant after Hector runs and use that to plot the figures. new R script for just figure generation. 
Github R script and dataframe. 
CH create repository and figure list

Figures:
time vs variable, CMIP5, obs, Hector and MAGICC, from 1850 to 2300
all 4 RCPs or faceted RCPs or different plots
1. atmospheric CO2
2. atmospheric temp
3. radiative forcing
4. fluxes --> gap between 2100 and 2300
5. NBB and RH ? 
6. ocean pH
Taylor plots, with MAGICC, CMIP models, and obs
7. atmospheric CO2
8. atmospheric temperature
